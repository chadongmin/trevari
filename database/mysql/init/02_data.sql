An instant success, the show ran until 1974, producing a total of 45 episodes. Despite the show''s very English humor and allusions to many things British, the series developed a cult following outside the U.K., particularly in the United States. Known for its outrageous humor, occasionally controversial content, and often silly spirit, Monty Python''s Flying Circus poked fun at nearly all institutions—domestic or foreign, grand or intimate, sacred or not. Indeed, many of the allusions and references in the program were uniquely British and routinely obscure, and therefore, not always understood or even noticed outside the British Isles. This exhaustive reference identifies and explains the plethora of cultural, historical, and topical allusions of this landmark series. In this resource, virtually every allusion and reference that appeared in an episode—whether stated by a character, depicted in the mise-en-scene, or mentioned in the printed scripts—is identified and explained.

Upon its release, Monty Python’s Life of Brian was both a critical and commercial success, and has been since hailed as one of the greatest comedies of all time. But the film also faced backlash from religious groups for its blasphemy, perceived or otherwise.

The first part of this book motivates the entire topic and highlights major challenges, trends and design criteria for log data analysis approaches, and further surveys and compares the state of the art. The second part of this book introduces concepts that apply character-based, rather than token-based, approaches and thus work on a more fine-grained level. Furthermore, these solutions were designed for “online use”, not only forensic analysis, but also process new log lines as they arrive in an efficient single pass manner. An advanced method for time series analysis aims at detecting changes in the overall behavior profile of an observed system and spotting trends and periodicities through log analysis. The third part of this book introduces the design of the AMiner, which is an advanced open source component for log data anomaly mining. The AMiner comes with several detectors to spot new events, new parameters, new correlations, new values and unknown value combinations and can run as stand-alone solution or as sensor with connection to a SIEM solution. More advanced detectors help to determines the characteristics of variable parts of log lines, specifically the properties of numerical and categorical fields. Detailed examples throughout this book allow the reader to better understand and apply the introduced techniques with open source software. Step-by-step instructions help to get familiar with the concepts and to better comprehend their inner mechanisms. A log test data set is available as free download and enables the reader to get the system up and running in no time.

And then doesn''t publish it for years and years.'' How we laughed, and each day we''d make up stuff this ‘person'' would write about us." --Eric Idle In 1978, Kim "Howard" Johnson ran away to join the circus---Monty Python''s Flying Circus, that is. The Pythons converged on Tunisia to film their timeless classic, Life of Brian, and Howard found himself in the thick of it, doubling for nearly all the Pythons, playing more roles in the film than John Cleese, and managing to ruin only one shot. He became the unit journalist, substitute still photographer, Roman soldier, peasant, Biggus Dickus''s double, near-stalker, and, ultimately, friend and confidant of the comedy legends. He also kept a detailed journal of what he saw and heard, on set and off, throughout those six weeks. The result is a unique eyewitness account that reveals the Pythons at work and at play in a way that nothing else written about them could do. Now, for the first time ever, the inside story of the making of the film is revealed through the fly-on-the-castle-wall perspective. Even the most diehard fans will get a fresh take on the comedy greats through some never-before-revealed nuggets of Python brilliance: what John Cleese offered to exchange for suntan lotion; Terry Jones directing in drag; Michael Palin''s secret to playing revolutionaries and peasants; Graham Chapman gets naked; Terry Gilliam gets filthy; Eric Idle haggles; the secret of the Thespo-Squat; Mrs. Pilate; talk of George Harrison; the cake-flinging that jeopardized the production; badminton, impromptu cricket, and erotic frescoes; and the first-ever presentation of "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life." Here, uncensored, are the legendary Pythons in their prime. It was a period of comedy history that will never be duplicated, and Monty Python''s Tunisian Holiday captures the wit, the genius, and the sheer silliness of the six men that comprised Python.', 443, 'BOOK', 24386, 'KRW', 'Macmillan', '2008-10-28', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8f2fIhvDx98C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

If you come from a background in ASP.NET development, you’ll be used to handling most interactions on the server side. Pro Single Page Application Development will guide you through your transition to this powerful new application type. The book starts in Part I by laying the groundwork for SPA development. You’ll master some JavaScript techniques that will come in useful later on, and get to know the building blocks of a single page application, including modules, routing and MV* frameworks. In Part II, you’ll build the client for your application. This is where the magic happens, as the authors take you through the process step by step. Backbone.js is the ideal library for demonstrating SPA development in practice, but you can apply the same principles with other frameworks in your future applications. Part III takes you through the process of building the server side of your application using ASP.NET Web API, and hooking up the two parts of your application to create a working whole. SPA development also comes with its own particular challenges, including tracking history, user interface performance, and how to handle search engine optimization. In the final chapters, the authors guide you through some of these issues and advanced techniques and finish by showing you how to deploy your application.

Summary Build stylish, slick, and speedy-to-load user interfaces in React without writing custom classes. React Hooks are a new category of functions that help you to manage state, lifecycle, and side effects within functional components. React Hooks in Action teaches you to use pre-built hooks like useState, useReducer and useEffect to build your own hooks. Your code will be more reusable, require less boilerplate, and you’ll instantly be a more effective React developer. About the technology Get started with React Hooks and you’ll soon have code that’s better organized and easier to maintain. React Hooks are targeted JavaScript functions that let you reuse and share functionality across components. Use them to split components into smaller functions, manage state and side effects, and access React features without classes—all without having to rearrange your component hierarchy. About the book React Hooks in Action teaches you to write fast and reusable React components using Hooks. You’ll start by learning to create component code with Hooks.

An assortment of houses, chambered cairns, stone circles, standing stones and passage graves provides an unusually comprehensive range of archaeological and architectural contexts. Yet, in the early 1990s, there was a noticeable imbalance between 4th and 3rd millennium cal BC evidence, with house structures, and ‘villages’ being well represented in the latter but minimally in the former. As elsewhere in the British Isles, the archaeological visibility of the 4th millennium cal BC in Orkney tends to be dominated by the monumental presence of chambered cairns or tombs. In the 1970s Claude Lévi-Strauss conceived of a form of social organization based upon the ‘house’ – sociétés à maisons – in order to provide a classification for social groups that appeared not to conform to established anthropological kinship structures. In this approach, the anchor point is the ‘house’, understood as a conceptual resource that is a consequence of a strategy of constructing and legitimizing identities under ever shifting social conditions. Drawing on the results of an extensive program of fieldwork in the Bay of Firth, Mainland Orkney, the text explores the idea that the physical appearance of the house is a potent resource for materializing the dichotomous alliance and descent principles apparent in the archaeological evidence for the early and later Neolithic of Orkney. It argues that some of the insights made by Lévi-Strauss in his basic formulation of sociétés à maisons are extremely relevant to interpreting the archaeological evidence and providing the parameters for a ‘social’ narrative of the material changes occurring in Orkney between the 4th and 2nd millennia cal BC. The major excavations undertaken during the Cuween-Wideford Landscape Project provided an unprecedented depth and variety of evidence for Neolithic occupation, bridging the gap between domestic and ceremonial architecture and form, exploring the transition from wood to stone and relationships between the living and the dead and the role of material culture.

Particular highlights of its sequence are a cremation burial ground and pyre site of the 18th–16th centuries BC and a row of three Late Bronze Age sunken-floored roundhouses constructed in the 10th century BC. Beneath these roundhouses, four inhumation graves contained skeletons, two of which were remains of composite collections of body parts with evidence for post-mortem soft tissue preservation prior to burial. They have proved to be the first evidence for mummification in Bronze Age Britain. Cladh Hallan’s remarkable stratigraphic sequence, preserved in the machair sand of South Uist, includes a unique 500-year sequence of roundhouse life in Late Bronze Age and Iron Age Britain. One of the most important results of the excavation has come from intensive environmental and micro-debris sampling of house floors and outdoor areas to recover patterns of discard and to interpret the spatial use of 15 domestic interiors from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age. From Cladh Hallan’s roundhouse floors we gain intimate insights into how daily life was organized within the house – where people cooked, ate, worked and slept. Such evidence rarely survives from prehistoric houses in Britain or Europe, and the results make a profound contribution to long-running debates about the sunwise organisation of roundhouse activities. Activity at Cladh Hallan ended with the construction and abandonment of two unusual double-roundhouses in the Early Iron Age.

Node.js를 강력하게 이용하려면 객체지향 프로그래밍 기법을 제공하는 타입스크립트가 필요합니다. 지금까지 Node.js는 서버 프레임워크로 익스프레스를 사용해왔지만 최근에는 NestJS를 채택하는 추세입니다. 하지만 현업에서는 이 두 도구를 모두 다룰 줄 알아야 하므로 이 책은 익스프레스와 NestJS를 모두 다룹니다. 그러면 3대장을 구체적으로 알아볼까요? 〈타입스크립트〉는 자바스크립트를 기반으로 정적 타입 문법을 추가한 프로그래밍 언어입니다. 대형 프로젝트에서 많이 사용하며, 요즘 대부분의 회사에서는 팀 작업 시 필수로 선택하는 언어입니다. ES6를 기반으로 한 새로운 문법을 제공하며, 자바스크립트와 완벽히 호환됩니다. 마이크로소프트의 지원을 받아 비교적 최근 언어이지만, 강력한 생태계를 가지고 있습니다(부록 A 참고). 〈Node.js〉는 서버 단에서 자바스크립트를 실행할 수 있는 자바스크립트 런타임입니다. Node.js는 요구사항이 많고 빠르게 변하는 환경에 있는 개발자에게 좋은 선택입니다. 프론트엔드와 같은 코드를 사용할 수도 있으며, Node.js의 개발자 생태계는 매우 풍성해서 개발 시간 단축 및 시스템의 안정성을 높일 수 있는 장점이 있습니다. 〈익스프레스〉는 Node.js에서 가장 많이 사용되는 웹 프레임워크입니다. 미니멀리스트 프레임워크를 지향하고 있으며, 확장이 용이한 구조로 되어 있어 많은 확장 라이브러리가 있습니다. 〈NestJS〉는 최신의 자바스크립트 최신 기술을 적용해, 생산성 있는 웹 애플리케이션을 빠르고 안정적으로 만들 수 있게 도와주는 웹 프레임워크입니다. 개발자 되기 시리즈는 여러분에게 앞으로 나아갈 길을 먼저 제시합니다 입문자를 위한 백엔드 로드맵을 만나보세요 저자는 백엔드 개발자로 입문할 때 겪은 난감함을 떠올렸습니다. 무엇을 어떻게 할지 몰랐습니다. 로드맵이 필요했습니다. 하지만 누구도 제대로 된 로드맵을 제공해주지 않았습니다. 그래서 저자는 입문자에게 필요한 백엔드 로드맵을 먼저 제시하고 설명합니다. 로드맵에는 수많은 기술이 나열되어 있습니다. 책 한 권에 로드맵에 있는 모든 걸 담을 수도, 한 번에 모두 배울 수도 없습니다. 이 책은 그중에서도 출발점으로 삼을 기본 지식을 자바스크립트 Node.js를 중심으로 추려 알려줍니다. 실무에 유용한 기술로 익히세요 기술은 빠르게 변합니다. 지금은 대세이지만 지는 기술, 아직은 미약하지만 뜨는 기술이 있습니다. 트렌드가 변하는 데는 그럴 만한 이유가 있습니다. 반면 기본은 트렌드와 무관하게 변하지 않습니다. 그래서 기본은 탄탄하게, 기술셋은 트렌디하면서 실무에 유용하게 설명했습니다. 경험을 녹인 고퀄리티 코드를 접하세요 인터넷을 검색하면 손쉽게 동작하는 코드를 얻을 수 있습니다. 그렇게 얻은 코드 대부분은 기능이 부족하거나 서비스가 성장하면서 다양한 이슈를 낳게 됩니다. 이 책에 들어 있는 코드는 그런 인터넷 복붙 코드가 아닙니다. 대규모 서비스를 개발하고 운영한 경험을 녹인 코드입니다. 예를 들어 게시판 코드는 많지만, 실무에 진짜로 필요한 기능을 제대로 제공하는 코드는 인터넷에 없습니다. 이 책에서 제대로 동작하는 검색, 댓글 첨삭, 페이지네이션, 파일 업로드, 소셜 로그인 기능을 담은 게시판을 만나보기 바랍니다. 변경하거나 수정한 코드를 확실하게 표시합니다. 현업에서처럼 이 책에서도 지속적으로 코드를 수정해 완성하기 때문에 기존 코드 어디를 수정 혹은 삭제했는지 알 수 있어야 합니다. 편리하게 찾을 수 있게 변경 사항이 있는 코드를 삭제선과 노란 배경색으로 표시했습니다. 이 책에서 다루는 내용을 소개합니다 이 책은 학습 흐름을 끊지 않기 위해 개발 환경부터 미리 구축해놓은 후, Node.js를 중심으로 레벨 1부터 레벨 3로 나눠 자바스크립트 백엔드 개발 소양을 쌓아 나갑니다. 모든 장에는 연습문제를 수록했으며, 부록 A에서는 ‘타입스크립트 입문에서 고급 기능까지’, 부록 B에서는 ‘꼭 알아야 하는 리눅스 명령어 21개’를 알려드립니다. _Level 1 백엔드 개발자 입문하기 0장에서 개발 환경을 구축한 후에, 1장에서 백엔드 개발자가 무엇을 알아야 하는지와 어떤 일을 하는지 안내합니다. 알아두면 도움이 되는 넓고 얕은 지식을 알려드리기 때문에 생소한 단어가 많이 출현할 겁니다. 한 번에 모든 걸 이해하려 들지 않아도 됩니다. 처음에 한 번 읽고 나서, 나머지 책 분량을 모두 읽은 후 다시 읽어보세요. 그러면 ‘백엔드 개발자 되기’라는 궁극의 의도를 제대로 파악할 수 있을 겁니다. _Level 2 Node.js와 Express로 백엔드 입문하기 최종 목표는 익스프레스(Express)로 게시판을 만들 수 있는 능력을 습득하는 겁니다. 사용자의 요구사항을 처리하고 반영하고 수정하는 게시판을 만들면 실무에 필요한 다양한 기술을 익힐 수 있습니다. 2장에서는 Node.js 동작 방식, 3장에서는 익스프레스로 웹 서버 만들기, 4장에서는 npm 사용 방법, 5장에서는 자바스크립트 비동기 처리 방법, 6장에서는 몽고디비를 다룹니다. 7장에서는 검색과 댓글 첨삭과 페이지네이션이되는 게시판을 만듭니다. _Level 3 NestJS 프레임워크로 점핑하기 NestJS를 활용해 개발하는 방법을 알아봅시다. 8장에서는 NestJS를 알아보고, 9장에서는 NestJS 환경 변수 설정하기, 10장에서는 회원 가입과 로그인, 11장에서는 OAuth를 사용한 구글 로그인 인증, 12장에서는 파일 업로드 기능을 구현합니다. 마지막으로 13장에서는 웹소켓으로 실시간 채팅을 구현합니다. 함께 만들 예제를 소개합니다 _express로 댓글 첨삭과 페이지네이션이 되는 게시판 만들기(7장) 게시판은 웹 프레임워크로 만들 때 자주 등장하는 예제입니다. 하지만 제대로 된 게시판을 만들려면 생각보다 고려해야 할 사항이 많습니다. 검색, 페이징, 상세페이지에서 댓글 영역 처리하기 등을 제공하는 일은 상당히 까다롭습니다. 게시판만 잘 만들 수 있다면 현업에 필요한 대부분의 로직을 만들 수 있다고 해도 아주 틀린 말은 아닐 겁니다. 실제로 사용할 수 있을 정도의 기능을 가지고 있는 게시판을 함께 구현해봅니다. _구글 OAuth를 사용해 구글 로그인 구현해보기(10장, 11장) 구글의 OAuth를 사용해 인증을 구현합니다. OAuth는 2006년에 구글과 트위터가 만든 개방형 인가의 표준입니다. 네이버, 구글, 카카오톡 등이 OAuth 기능을 활용한 소셜 로그인을 지원합니다.

There are - sentially six different flavors of referential integrity but Access only s- ports four of them (they are the most important ones however, so you aren’t missing out on too much). The problem is this. Should we tell you about the other two? If we do, as an Access user you have every right to be annoyed that we are telling you about a feature you can’t use. On the other hand, the six different types that we describe are part of the re- tional world and this book is about that world – we are not trying to teach you how to use Access, we are simply using Access to illustrate the relational model. Ultimately we decided to risk your ire and to describe all of the features of the relational model as we see it, even if Access doesn’t support all of them. One advantage of this approach is that if you need to use a different database engine you will almost certainly find the extra information useful. Incidentally, this is not meant to imply that Access is somehow lacking as a relational database engine. The reason we chose it for the first book is that it is such a good example of a relational database tool.', 376, 'BOOK', 63876, 'KRW', 'Springer Science & Business Media', '2007-04-06', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XVrqkyceJQUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

OWI event를 중심으로 Library Cache에 아키텍처를 추론하여 짐작하였을 뿐, 명확하게 구조적으로 설명된 자료는 없었다. 명확한 구조를 모른다는 것은 정확한 솔루션을 제시하지 못한다는 것이다. 국내의 서적 뿐만 아니라 해외의 유명한 구루들의 서적에서도 마찬가지였다. 예를 들면, enq lock은 holder session과 waiter session 단 2개로 locking 상황을 재현하면서 비교적 명쾌하게 설명이 가능했으나 Library Cache에서는 수많은 세션을 동시에 실행시켜서 부하 테스트 방법으로 비슷한 상황을 재현할 수 있을 뿐 enq처럼 명확하게 설명되지 못했다. 현장의 많은 DBA들은 정확한 이유도 모른 체 flush 명령을 내리거나, 세션을 kill 시키고 sql의 hard parsing을 줄이기 위한 bind variable을 쓸 뿐 정확한 메커니즘에 대한 이해가 부족했다. 필자 역시 후배와 수많은 Library Cache 덤프를 떠보고 국내외 유명 서적을 탐독했으나 그 내부구조에 대한 원리를 명확히 이해할 수 없어서 답답하기만 하였다. 그런 답답함이 이번 연구를 통하여 많이 해소되었다.

KEY FEATURES ● Every chapter and concept is illustrated through the use of the Jakarta Project. ● Extensive hands-on demonstration of Jakarta EE specifications and capabilities. ● Practical examples of securing Java applications with Jakarta Security are provided. DESCRIPTION This book provides a practical introduction to Enterprise Java Edition, Jakarta EE, including detailed features and capabilities. Equipped with numerous projects, each chapter demonstrates Jakarta EE capabilities with clean coding. The book starts with an introduction to Jakarta EE and its architecture. This will help to create a project using the Jakarta Servlet and exposure of an HTTP endpoint. The CDI is then used to inject dependencies, work with events asynchronously, and interact with CDI interceptors. Then, in the RESTful style, it can help to create a Jakarta RESTful resource to expose HTTP endpoints. We then investigate the Jakarta Enterprise Bean, which teaches us how to manage transactions and schedule tasks. The Jakarta Persistence is then used to integrate an application into a relational database, and the Jakarta Message is used to create an application using the Message Oriented Middleware (MOM). In terms of security, we use Jakarta Security to secure the endpoint of a Jakarta application.

You will learn a framework that finally cracks the problem of merging data and process models into a meaningful and unified design that accounts for how data is actually used in production systems. Key to the framework is a method for taking the logical data model that is a static look at the definition of the data, and merging that static look with the process models describing how the data will be used in actual practice once a given system is implemented. The approach solves the disconnect between the static definition of data in the logical data model and the dynamic flow of the data in the logical process models. The design framework in this book can be used to create operational databases for transaction processing systems, or for data warehouses in support of decision support systems. The information manager can be a flat file, Oracle Database, IMS, NoSQL, Cassandra, Hadoop, or any other DBMS. Usage-Driven Database Design emphasizes practical aspects of design, and speaks to what works, what doesn’t work, and what to avoid at all costs.

Using Apache Cordova, developers can create a new type of mobile app—a hybrid mobile app. Hybrid mobile apps actually run in an internal browser inside a wrapper created by Apache Cordova. With hybrid mobile apps, developers can have one single code base for different platforms. Developers also can use their existing web development skills. The Ionic framework builds on top of Apache Cordova and provides out-of-box components which make developing hybrid mobile apps much easier. Ionic uses Angular as the JavaScript framework and has a nice default UI style with a similar look and feel to native apps.

The first three volumes of this work have long comprised a unique and invaluable resource in programming theory and practice. Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of Knuth’s analysis, while practicing programmers have successfully applied his “cookbook” solutions to their day-to-day problems. The level of these first three volumes has remained so high, and they have displayed so wide and deep a familiarity with the art of computer programming, that a sufficient “review” of future volumes could almost be: “Knuth, Volume n has been published.” –Data Processing Digest Knuth, Volume n has been published, where n = 4A. In this long-awaited new volume, the old master turns his attention to some of his favorite topics in broadword computation and combinatorial generation (exhaustively listing fundamental combinatorial objects, such as permutations, partitions, and trees), as well as his more recent interests, such as binary decision diagrams. The hallmark qualities that distinguish his previous volumes are manifest here anew: detailed coverage of the basics, illustrated with well-chosen examples; occasional forays into more esoteric topics and problems at the frontiers of research; impeccable writing peppered with occasional bits of humor; extensive collections of exercises, all with solutions or helpful hints; a careful attention to history; implementations of many of the algorithms in his classic step-by-step form. There is an amazing amount of information on each page. Knuth has obviously thought long and hard about which topics and results are most central and important, and then, what are the most intuitive and succinct ways of presenting that material. Since the areas that he covers in this volume have exploded since he first envisioned writing about them, it is wonderful how he has managed to provide such thorough treatment in so few pages. –Frank Ruskey, Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria The book is Volume 4A, because Volume 4 has itself become a multivolume undertaking. Combinatorial searching is a rich and important topic, and Knuth has too much to say about it that is new, interesting, and useful to fit into a single volume, or two, or maybe even three. This book alone includes approximately 1500 exercises, with answers for self-study, plus hundreds of useful facts that cannot be found in any other publication. Volume 4A surely belongs beside the first three volumes of this classic work in every serious programmer’s library.

In many cases, this is often the dominating computational cost. Given an optimization problem satisfying reasonable assumptions—and given access to problem-function values and derivatives of various degrees—how many evaluations might be required to approximately solve the problem? Evaluation Complexity of Algorithms for Nonconvex Optimization: Theory, Computation, and Perspectives addresses this question for nonconvex optimization problems, those that may have local minimizers and appear most often in practice. This is the first book on complexity to cover topics such as composite and constrained optimization, derivative-free optimization, subproblem solution, and optimal (lower and sharpness) bounds for nonconvex problems. It is also the first to address the disadvantages of traditional optimality measures and propose useful surrogates leading to algorithms that compute approximate high-order critical points, and to compare traditional and new methods, highlighting the advantages of the latter from a complexity point of view. This is the go-to book for those interested in solving nonconvex optimization problems.

AI-generated designs and works are becoming more popular. Today, AI technologies can generate several intellectual creations. Fashion is one of the industries that AI can profoundly impact. AI tools and devices are currently being used in the fashion industry to create fashion models, fabric and jewellery designs, and clothing. When we talk about AI-generated designs, we instead focus on the fruits of innovation – more best-selling apparels, more fashionable designs and more fulfilment of customer expectations – without paying heed to who the designer is. Designers invest a lot of talent, time and finances into designing and creating each article of clothing and accessory before they release their work to the public. Pattern drafting is the first and most important step in dressmaking. Designers typically start with a general sketch on paper; add styles, elements and colours; revise and refine everything; and finally deliver their design to dressmakers. AI accelerates this time-consuming and labour-intensive process. Yet the full legal consequences of AI in fashion industry are often forgotten. An AI device’s ability to generate fashion designs raises the question of who will own intellectual property rights over the fashion designs. Will it be the fashion designer who hires or contracts with the AI programmer? Will it be the programmer? Will it be the AI itself? Or will it be a joint work of humans and computers? And who will be liable for infringement deriving from use of third-party material in AI-generated fashion designs? This book explores answers to these questions within the framework of EU design and copyright laws. It also crafts a solution proposal based on a three-step test and model norms, which could be used to unleash the authors, rights holders and infringers around AI-generated fashion designs.', 203, 'BOOK', 74542, 'KRW', 'Taylor & Francis', '2022-12-30', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-MGZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

AI는 단순한 정보 제공을 넘어 시간과 공간의 한계를 초월하는 소통의 매개체로 작용하며, 이를 통해 리더십의 본질도 새롭게 정의되고 있다. 자아의 성장과 번영은 윤리적 리더십을 통해 사회적 영향력을 확대하며, AI는 이러한 리더십을 더욱 정교하게 확장하는 역할을 한다. 자아를 형성하고 성장시키는 과정에서 인간은 실존적 불안을 경험하지만, 이를 극복하면서 개인의 가능성을 현실화하고 삶의 만족을 성취할 수 있다. AI는 이러한 과정에서 효율적인 도구로 기능하며, 인간이 더욱 창의적이고 전략적인 의사결정을 내릴 수 있도록 돕는다. 그러나 AI의 발전이 윤리적 판단을 대체할 수는 없다. AI는 방대한 데이터를 분석하여 최적의 결과를 제시할 수 있지만, 도덕적 가치나 인간적인 판단을 대신할 수는 없다. 따라서 윤리적 리더십이 더욱 중요한 시대가 도래하고 있으며, AI는 인간의 결정을 보조하는 역할을 수행해야 한다.

In addition, it provides an insight of deep neural networks in action with illustrative coding examples. Deep learning is a new area of machine learning research which has been introduced with the objective of moving ML closer to one of its original goals, i.e. artificial intelligence. Deep learning was developed as an ML approach to deal with complex input-output mappings. While traditional methods successfully solve problems where final value is a simple function of input data, deep learning techniques are able to capture composite relations between non-immediately related fields, for example between air pressure recordings and English words, millions of pixels and textual description, brand-related news and future stock prices and almost all real world problems. Deep learning is a class of nature inspired machine learning algorithms that uses a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. The learning may be supervised (e.g. classification) and/or unsupervised (e.g. pattern analysis) manners. These algorithms learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction by resorting to some form of gradient descent for training via backpropagation. Layers that have been used in deep learning include hidden layers of an artificial neural network and sets of propositional formulas. They may also include latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep boltzmann machines.

Deep Learning methods apply levels of learning to transform input data into more abstract and composite information. Handbook for Deep Learning in Biomedical Engineering: Techniques and Applications gives readers a complete overview of the essential concepts of Deep Learning and its applications in the field of Biomedical Engineering. Deep learning has been rapidly developed in recent years, in terms of both methodological constructs and practical applications. Deep Learning provides computational models of multiple processing layers to learn and represent data with higher levels of abstraction. It is able to implicitly capture intricate structures of large-scale data and is ideally suited to many of the hardware architectures that are currently available. The ever-expanding amount of data that can be gathered through biomedical and clinical information sensing devices necessitates the development of machine learning and AI techniques such as Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks to process and evaluate the data. Some examples of biomedical and clinical sensing devices that use Deep Learning include: Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Particle Imaging, EE/MEG, Optical Microscopy and Tomography, Photoacoustic Tomography, Electron Tomography, and Atomic Force Microscopy.

The primary focus is on the theory and algorithms of deep learning. The theory and algorithms of neural networks are particularly important for understanding important concepts, so that one can understand the important design concepts of neural architectures in different applications. Why do neural networks work? When do they work better than off-the-shelf machine-learning models? When is depth useful? Why is training neural networks so hard? What are the pitfalls? The book is also rich in discussing different applications in order to give the practitioner a flavor of how neural architectures are designed for different types of problems. Applications associated with many different areas like recommender systems, machine translation, image captioning, image classification, reinforcement-learning based gaming, and text analytics are covered. The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and 8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10.

It is intended both for newcomers to machine learning and for those already experienced in the field. Covering key concepts relating to contemporary architectures and techniques, this essential book equips readers with a robust foundation for potential future specialization. The field of deep learning is undergoing rapid evolution, and therefore this book focusses on ideas that are likely to endure the test of time. The book is organized into numerous bite-sized chapters, each exploring a distinct topic, and the narrative follows a linear progression, with each chapter building upon content from its predecessors. This structure is well-suited to teaching a two-semester undergraduate or postgraduate machine learning course, while remaining equally relevant to those engaged in active research or in self-study. A full understanding of machine learning requires some mathematical background and so the book includes a self-contained introduction to probability theory. However, the focus of the book is on conveying a clear understanding of ideas, with emphasis on the real-world practical value of techniques rather than on abstract theory. Complex concepts are therefore presented from multiple complementary perspectives including textual descriptions, diagrams, mathematical formulae, and pseudo-code.

You can use the Neural Net Time Series app to solve different kinds of time series problems It is generally best to start with the GUI, and then to use the GUI to automatically generate command line scripts. Before using either method, the first step is to define the problem by selecting a data set. Each GUI has access to many sample data sets that you can use to experiment with the toolbox. If you have a specific problem that you want to solve, you can load your own data into the workspace. With MATLAB is possibe to solve three different kinds of time series problems. In the first type of time series problem, you would like to predict future values of a time series y(t) from past values of that time series and past values of a second time series x(t). This form of prediction is called nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous (external) input, or NARX. In the second type of time series problem, there is only one series involved. The future values of a time series y(t) are predicted only from past values of that series. This form of prediction is called nonlinear autoregressive, or NAR. The third time series problem is similar to the first type, in that two series are involved, an input series (predictors) x(t) and an output series (responses) y(t).

This book is devoted to the Multi-Valued Neuron (MVN) and MVN-based neural networks. It contains a comprehensive observation of MVN theory, its learning, and applications. MVN is a complex-valued neuron whose inputs and output are located on the unit circle. Its activation function is a function only of argument (phase) of the weighted sum. MVN derivative-free learning is based on the error-correction rule. A single MVN can learn those input/output mappings that are non-linearly separable in the real domain. Such classical non-linearly separable problems as XOR and Parity n are the simplest that can be learned by a single MVN. Another important advantage of MVN is a proper treatment of the phase information. These properties of MVN become even more remarkable when this neuron is used as a basic one in neural networks. The Multilayer Neural Network based on Multi-Valued Neurons (MLMVN) is an MVN-based feedforward neural network. Its backpropagation learning algorithm is derivative-free and based on the error-correction rule. It does not suffer from the local minima phenomenon. MLMVN outperforms many other machine learning techniques in terms of learning speed, network complexity and generalization capability when solving both benchmark and real-world classification and prediction problems. Another interesting application of MVN is its use as a basic neuron in multi-state associative memories.

NLP의 우수성은 굳이 문제의 원인을 모르더라도 내 마음의 작용을 반대로 바꾸면 모든 심리적인 문제를 해결할 수 있다는 데에 있다. 그리고 대상이나 상황에 대한 내 마음의 고정관념을 반대로 바꾸는 것은 어렵지 않다. 그것은 상상을 통해 가능하다. 본 책의 특징 중 하나는 현대 물리학의 하나의 큰 기둥인 양자역학적 관점에서 NLP 치료 원리를 소개함으로써 NLP의 과학적 이해를 도우려고 한 점이다. 이 책을 통해 양자역학의 여러 원리들이 NLP 심리치료에 어떻게 적용되는지 알 수 있을 것이다. 양자역학에 의하면 집중력을 발휘하여 상상에 깊이 몰입할수록 상상을 실체화하는 것이 가능하다고 한다. NLP는 잠재의식이 활성화된 상태에서 구체적 상상을 통해 내가 바라는 변화, 심리상태를 이끌어 내기에 생각을 실체화한다는 양자역학의 원리와 일맥상통한다. 이러한 원리를 이용하면 평소에 건강한 정신생활을 위해서는 평소 부정적인 상념에 빠져들지 않고 그냥 흘려버리는 태도가 제일 중요하다는 결론이 나온다. 걱정이나 불안에 대해 자꾸 신경 쓰지 말고 얼른 잊어버리는 태도가 중요하다. NLP의 치료 원리는 의외로 간단하다. NLP를 한마디로 정의한다면, ‘내가 상상하는 대로 그대로 이루어진다’는 것이다. 여기서의 상상은 오감을 동원한 실감나는 상상을 의미한다. 즉, 실재처럼 상상을 실감나게 한다면 그 상상이 현실로 그대로 이루어진다. 따라서 심신이 이완된 상태, 즉 편안한 상태에서 내가 바라는 상태를 구체적으로 상상하기만 하면 내가 원하는 정서 상태나 목표를 성취할 수 있게 된다. NLP는 쉽게 말해 심신이 이완된 상태에서 구체적 상상을 통해 마음의 변화를 이끌어내는 기술이다. 그리고 마음의 변화는 생각(의식)의 변화를 가져오고 생각의 변화는 행동의 변화를 가져온다. NLP는 치료 성과와 효율 측면에서 볼 때 최고의 기법이다. 독자들은 이 책에 제시된 구체적 기법들과 사례들을 스스로 적용해 봄으로써 놀라운 마음의 변화를 경험할 수 있기를 바란다.', 281, 'BOOK', 15000, 'KRW', '교육과학사', '2025-02-28', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I4RDEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Abstract: The development of large scale software systems in a systematic way is still a challenging task in software engineering. The use of structural, modular and object oriented programming techniques and environments have proven to be powerful and reliable for the creation of correct, reusable and maintainable software. Specifically, the object oriented programming model has improved the quality of software by providing structures for better support of abstraction, encapsulation and reusability. In recent years, these properties have become more important since hardware and software systems have grown bigger and more complex. Also, customers have made higher requirements an the quality of software. Object oriented programming languages like Eiffel, Smalltalk or C++ provide basic facilities for network programming, database access, etc. in form of class libraries which exploit these concepts. This helps developers concentrate an the solving of the actual problems, without having to spend time an reinventing already implemented solutions to common problems. The object-oriented paradigm primarily involve objects. These usually represent abstractions of real world entities. Objects are typically defined by classes in programming languages.

Through numerous examples, individually documented pattern profiles, and over 400 color illustrations, this book provides in-depth coverage of: • Patterns for the design, implementation, and governance of service inventories–collections of services representing individual service portfolios that can be independently modeled, designed, and evolved. • Patterns specific to service-level architecture which pertain to a wide range of design areas, including contract design, security, legacy encapsulation, reliability, scalability, and a variety of implementation and governance issues. • Service composition patterns that address the many aspects associated with combining services into aggregate distributed solutions, including topics such as runtime messaging and message design, inter-service security controls, and transformation. • Compound patterns (such as Enterprise Service Bus and Orchestration) and recommended pattern application sequences that establish foundational processes. The book begins by establishing SOA types that are referenced throughout the patterns and then form the basis of a final chapter that discusses the architectural impact of service-oriented computing in general. These chapters bookend the pattern catalog to provide a clear link between SOA design patterns, the strategic goals of service-oriented computing, different SOA types, and the service-orientation design paradigm.

Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer–but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code–lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code–of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.

We address how these groups can adapt to Agile teams. More importantly, we show how many Agile teams cause their own problems, damaging scalability and sustainability, by requiring special treatment, and by failing to bridge the gaps between themselves and other groups. We call this phenomenon “Agile illth.” Adopting a set of “best practices” is not enough. All of us, Agile teams and the corporate groups, must change our intentions and worldviews to be more compatible with the success of the enterprise. Join us on the journey to enterpriseagility.

[ 1장 스프링 부트 입문하기 ]스프링 부트의 다양한 스타터를 살펴보며 각 의존성과 부가 정보를 어떻게 확인하는지 알아봅니다. 이를 위해 스프링 부트 프로젝트의 특징을 이해하고 스프링 부트를 이용해서 어떻게 프로젝트를 구성하고 개발하는지 살펴봅니다. [ 2장 스프링 부트 환경 설정 ]스프링 부트 개발 환경을 구축합니다. JDK를 설치하고 인텔리제이 IDEA를 살펴봅니다. 아울러 그레이들(Gradle)로 빌드하고 멀티 프로젝트를 구성하여 공통 사용되는 코드를 재활용합니다. 이어서 1장에서 살펴보았던 분산된 의존성이 어떻게 하나로 모아져 자동 설정되는지도 알아보겠습니다. [ 3장 스프링 부트 테스트 ]기본적인 테스트 스타터를 알아봅니다. 스타터는 크게 두 가지 모듈로 구성됩니다. 하나는 spring-boot-test이고 다른 하나는 spring-boot-test-autoconfigure이며 테스트 관련 자동 설정 기능을 제공합니다. 보통은 spring-boot-starter-test로 두 모듈을 함께 사용합니다. 자주 사용하는 어노테이션도 살펴봅니다. [ 4장 스프링 부트 웹 ]스프링 부트 웹을 이용하여 커뮤니티 게시판을 만듭니다. 스프링 부트 웹은 주로 뷰 페이지나 API 용도로 사용합니다. 이 장에서는 커뮤니티 게시판의 뷰 페이지를 만드는 방법을 다루고 API는 7장에서 스프링 부트 데이터 레스트(REST)를 사용하여 다룹니다. [ 5장 스프링 부트 시큐리티 + OAuth2 ]스프링 부트 1.5 버전에서 지원하는 스프링 시큐리티와 OAuth2 API를 빠르고 쉽게 적용해봅니다. 2.0 버전부터는 스프링 시큐리티 내부에 OAuth2 API가 포함되었습니다. 두 가지 버전 모두 알아봅니다. [ 6장 스프링 부트 데이터 레스트 ]REST는 웹의 장점을 극대화하는 통신 네트워크 아키텍처입니다. REST API 개발을 기존의 MVC 패턴으로도 해보고, 스프링 부트 데이터 레스트를 사용하여 개발하며 어떻게 다른지 장단점을 비교합니다. 그 결과 제대로 REST API를 만드는 방법을 익히게 됩니다. [ 7장 스프링 부트 배치 ]스프링 부트 배치는 백엔드의 배치 처리 기능을 구현하는 데 사용하는 프레임워크입니다. 스프링 부트 배치를 간단히 소개하고, 스프링 부트 배치를 써야 하는 이유와 스프링 부트 배치 2.0에 강화된 기능에 대해 알아봅니다. 끝으로 휴면회원 전환 기능을 직접 개발해봅니다.

But first, let''s learn what GraphQL really is and - maybe even more importantly - let''s figure out how to apply GraphQL to build APIs that consumers love. Do you like to learn hands-on? In this book, we take a hands-on approach to learning GraphQL. We first explore the concepts of the two GraphQL languages using examples. Then we start writing some code for our first GraphQL API. We develop this API step by step, from creating a schema and resolving queries, over mocking data and connecting data sources all the way to developing mutations and setting up event subscriptions. Are your API consumers important to you? This book shows you how to apply a consumer-oriented design process for GraphQL APIs, so you can deliver what your consumers really want: an API that solves their problems and offers a great developer experience. Do you want to enable the API consumers so they can build great apps? This book explains the GraphQL query language, which allows the API consumers to retrieve data, write data and get notified when data changes. More importantly, you let them decide, which data they really need from the API. Do you want to make your API easy and intuitive to use? This book shows you how to use the GraphQL schema language to define a type system for your API, which serves as a reference documentation and helps your API consumers write queries that are syntactically correct.

GraphQL is a language for querying or manipulating resources or data against data sources such as databases. In addition, graphql also provides a runtime for processing queries and other graphql objects. The language and runtime were originally built by Facebook in 2012 to be used internally. In 2015 graphql began to be published in open source to the public. GraphQL provides another alternative for developing api services besides those based on REST. Several leading companies including Facebook itself already use graphql such as github, pinterest, airbnb, paypal, twitter, and others. There are several things that distinguish graphql from rest services, including: - GraphQL provides data according to your needs, nothing less and nothing more. Output data properties or columns can be determined dynamically, in contrast to rest services that have determined data from any column to be displayed. - GraphQL provides one endpoint for all resources or all data provided, in contrast to rest api that provides resources or data through multiple endpoints or multiple controllers. - The data response displayed from graphql will be structurally the same as the data structure requested by the client. - GraphQL can provide multiple resources or data in one request. Rest services should provide it with multiple urls. The topics described in this book start from the explanation of graphql & asp.net core architecture; installation of the necessary libraries; creation of asp.net core web in visual studio; use of ef core for database access sql server & postgresql; use of queries and mutations; use of tools for graphql access; use of logging and data loaders; real-time services with subscription; implementation of asp.net core identity; use of jwt authentication; deployment; and many more. The discussion in this book is carried out in stages, so that it is hoped that after studying it, readers will have sufficient skills or abilities to build GraphQL-based services with ASP.NET Core according to the needs in the field. Hopefully this book can be another alternative as a learning resource for exercises, tutorials, or a reference for those who want to learn the backend programming of GraphQL API Services with ASP.NET Core that is connected to SQL Server and PostgreSQL databases.', 163, 'BOOK', 8374, 'KRW', 'Native Enterprise', '2020-08-10', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L232DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

The business side expected faster time to market, but they still experience the long delays of bloated releases. Engineers thought they would be given time to build the product right the first time, but they are rushed under pressure to deliver new features within impossible schedules. What went wrong? The culprit is feature-based waterfall release planning perpetuated in a vain attempt to achieve business predictability. Agile didn''t address the business need for multi-year financial predictability. The Agile community''s answer was the naïve response, "The business needs to be more Agile." Waterfall release planning with fixed schedules undercuts a basic tenet of Agile development – the need to adjust content delivered within a timebox to account for evolving requirements and incorporation of feedback. Agile without flexible content is not Agile. This book introduces a novel solution that enables product teams to deliver higher value within shorter cycle times while meeting the predictability needs of the business. Organizations today want product teams that break down walls between product management and engineering to achieve schedule and financial objectives. Until now they haven’t had a way to implement product teams within the rigid constraints of traditional organizational structures. The Investment planning approach described in this book supports small development increments planned and developed by product teams aligned by common schedule and financial goals. It uses Cost of Delay principles to prioritize work with the highest value and shortest cycle times. Investments provide a vehicle for collaboration and innovation and fulfill the promise of highly motivated self-directed Agile development teams. This book is for engineers, product managers and project managers who want to finally do Agile the way it was envisioned.

Um auf dem Markt mitzuhalten und dabei noch für potenzielle Kunden aus der Masse hervorzustechen, müssen die Unternehmen die "Time-to-market" auf ein Minimum bis hin zu "On-Demand"-Auslieferung via OTA reduzieren. Dies wird bereits von einigen disruptiven Herstellern wie z.B. Tesla getan und führt nachweislich zu hoher Kundenzufriedenheit. Besonders bei den alteingesessenen Unternehmen, in der Regel OEMs, fällt auf, dass diese immer häufiger von der Komplexität der ständig steigenden Kundenanforderungen überfordert sind und es immer häufiger vorkommt, dass Liefertermine nicht eingehalten werden können und die Qualität der Software darunter leidet. In der IT-Welt wurde gerade dies durch die Einführung der kollaborativen DevOps-Kultur ermöglicht. Der Fokus der Methoden liegt dabei auf schnellerem Feedback für die Entwickler und der damit einhergehenden Möglichkeit der schnelleren Auslieferung von Software-Verbesserung für den Kunden. Dabei muss zwischen der reinen Webentwicklung und der Embedded-Systementwicklung unterschieden werden. Gerade bei der Einführung der DevOps-Methoden in der Embedded-Systementwicklung verlaufen die ersten Schritte im Vergleich zur Webentwicklung nicht geradlinig. Besonders für Unternehmen aus dem Embedded-Systementwicklungsbereich lässt sich daher in den letzten Jahren ein stetig steigender Beratungsbedarf beobachten. Das vorliegende Praxisbeispiel soll die Idee hinter der Masterarbeit verdeutlichen: Der Kunde möchte sich über den Ist-Zustand seiner eigenen Entwicklungsmethodik sowie auf ihn zukommende Kosten bei nötiger Aktualisierung informieren. Der Kunde erwartet dabei eine individuelle Beratung mit anschließender Umsetzung zum Thema DevOps, Systementwicklung und eine Einschätzung des ROI. Das Ziel ist es somit, die Zufriedenheit des Kunden zu steigern, eine schnelle Erfassung und Darstellung des Ist-Zustands zu liefern, einen Überblick über entstehende Kosten bei Aktualisierung zu geben und dabei die langfristige Ersparnis bei Neuerung aufzuzeigen. Aufbau der Arbeit: 1) Analyse bestehender Modelle mit Fokus auf Embedded-Systementwicklung 2) Konzepterstellung eines Kompetenzmodells in Verbindung mit einem ROI- / Kostenmodell 3) Evaluierung der beiden Modelle durch interne und externe Projekte 4) Fokus auf Gewährleistung von Effizienz inklusive Gewichtung nach Signifikanz und Relevanz', 149, 'BOOK', 7152, 'KRW', 'GRIN Verlag', '2020-10-15', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2TkDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Furthermore, it shows how knowledge of the meaning within information and the use to which it will be put have to be held in common between enterprises for consistent and efficient inter-enterprise networks. Over 30 papers, ranging from academic research through case studies to industrial and administrative experience of interoperability show how, in a scenario of globalised markets, where the capacity to cooperate with other organizations efficiently is essential in order to remain economically, socially and environmentally cost-effective, the most innovative digitized and networked enterprises ensure that their systems and applications are able to interoperate across heterogeneous collaborative networks of independent organizations. This goal of interoperability is essential, not only from the perspective of the individual enterprise but also in the business structures that are now emerging, such as complex collaborating networks of suppliers and customers, virtual enterprises, interconnected organisations or extended enterprises, as well as in mergers and acquisitions. Establishing efficient and relevant collaborative situations requires the management of interoperability from a dynamic point of view: a relevant and efficient collaboration of organizations may require adaptation to remain in line with changing objectives, evolving resources, unexpected events, etc. Many of the papers contained in this, the eighth volume of Proceedings of the I-ESA Conferences have examples and illustrations calculated to deepen understanding and generate new ideas.

We expect that within a short timeframe embedded systems will be a part of nearly all equipment designed or manufactured in Europe, the USA, and Asia. There is now a strategic shift in emphasis for embedded systems designers: from simply achieving feasibility, to achieving optimality. Optimal design of embedded systems means targeting a given market segment at the lowest cost and delivery time possible. Optimality implies seamless integration with the physical and electronic environment while respecting real-world constraints such as hard deadlines, reliability, availability, robustness, power consumption, and cost.

In view of the all-pervasive nature of IT in today’s world a decision has been taken by many universities to introduce IT as a compulsory core course to all Bachelor’s degree students regardless of their specialisation. This book is intended for such a course. The approach taken in this book is to emphasize the fundamental “Science” of Information Technology rather than a cook book of skills. Skills can be learnt easily by practice with a computer and by using instructions given in simple web lessons that have been cited in the References. The book defines Information Technology as the technology that is used to acquire, store, organize, process and disseminate processed data, namely, information. The unique aspect of the book is to examine processing all types of data: numbers, text, images, audio and video data. As IT is a rapidly changing field, we have taken the approach to emphasize reasonably stable, fundamental concepts on which the technology is built. A unique feature of the book is the discussion of topics such as image, audio and video compression technologies from first principles. We have also described the latest technologies such as ‘e-wallets’ and ‘cloud computing’. The book is suitable for all Bachelor’s degree students in Science, Arts, Computer Applications, and Commerce. It is also useful for general reading to learn about IT and its latest trends. Those who are curious to know, the principles used to design jpg, mp3 and mpeg4 compression, the image formats—bmp, tiff, gif, png, and jpg, search engines, payment systems such as BHIM and Paytm, and cloud computing, to mention a few of the technologies discussed, will find this book useful.

The traditional approaches to software development and deployment, which often involve extended release cycles, manual interventions, and siloed teams, are no longer sufficient to meet the demands of modern enterprises. As organizations increasingly rely on technology to fuel growth and deliver value to customers, the need for agility, speed, and continuous improvement has never been more critical. This is where DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) come into play. “Automating the Modern Enterprise: A Practical Guide to DevOps, CI/CD” is designed to provide a comprehensive roadmap for implementing DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines in modern enterprises. This book offers a firsthand, practical approach to automation, aimed at helping organizations break down traditional silos, streamline development processes, and accelerate the delivery of high-quality software. Whether you are an IT leader, a developer, a DevOps engineer, or a business executive, this guide will equip you with the knowledge and tools to harness the power of automation and transform your organization’s software development and delivery process. DevOps is not just a set of tools or practices; it is a cultural shift that encourages collaboration, transparency, and shared responsibility across development, operations, and security teams. By automating key parts of the software lifecycle—such as build, testing, deployment, and monitoring—DevOps helps organizations increase productivity, improve quality, and respond to customer needs more quickly. CI/CD, as the cornerstone of DevOps, enables teams to deliver code changes rapidly and reliably, ensuring that software is always in a deployable state. In this book, we explore the full spectrum of DevOps and CI/CD practices, from building and optimizing pipelines to integrating security and monitoring into the process. We provide in-depth discussions of the key principles of DevOps, covering topics like continuous integration, continuous deployment, version control, configuration management, and automated testing. You will also learn how to leverage tools like Jenkins, GitLab, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and many others to automate and streamline your software development and deployment processes. One of the key aspects of successful DevOps implementation is fostering collaboration and communication across teams. We dive into how you can create a culture that embraces change, continuous learning, and shared accountability. We also highlight the importance of incorporating security into every step of the development pipeline—what is often referred to as DevSecOps—ensuring that your automation efforts do not compromise the security of your systems. As enterprises grow and the complexity of their software systems increases, scaling DevOps and CI/CD becomes an essential challenge. This book addresses how to scale automation to meet the demands of large organizations, optimizing pipeline performance, managing infrastructure as code, and ensuring that your DevOps practices evolve with your enterprise’s needs. The transformation to DevOps and CI/CD is not without its challenges. Legacy systems, organizational resistance, and the complexities of integrating diverse tools can slow down progress. However, the benefits of this transformation are undeniable: faster release cycles, higher-quality software, improved collaboration, and enhanced customer satisfaction. This book will provide you with the strategies, tools, and real-world examples needed to overcome these challenges and drive successful DevOps adoption. By the end of this guide, you will have a clear understanding of how to implement and scale DevOps and CI/CD within your organization. You will also have practical knowledge to automate repetitive tasks, optimize workflows, reduce downtime, and empower your teams to deliver value faster. Whether you are just beginning your DevOps journey or looking to refine your existing practices, this book will serve as an invaluable resource for transforming your enterprise into a fully automated, agile, and modern software-driven organization.

Emerging from a growing conservative culture industry, the genre dramatizes events that many believers expect to occur at the end of the age - the rapture of the saved, the rise of the Antichrist, and the fearful tribulation faced by those who are "left behind." Seeking the forces that drove the unexpected success of the Left Behind novels, Crawford Gribben traces the gradual development of the prophecy fiction genre from its eclectic roots among early twentieth-century fundamentalists. The first rapture novels came onto the scene at the high water mark of Protestant America. From there, the genre would both witness the defeat of conservative Protestantism and participate in its eventual reconstruction and return, providing for the renaissance of the evangelical imagination that would culminate in the Left Behind novels. Yet, as Gribben shows, the rapture genre, while vividly expressing some prototypically American themes, also serves to greatly complicate the idea of American modernity-assaulting some of its most cherished tenets. Gribben concludes with a look at "post-Left Behind" rapture fiction, noting some works that were written specifically to counter the claims of the best-selling series. Along the way, he gives attention not just to literary fictions, but to rapture films and apocalyptic themes in Christian music. Writing the Rapture is an indispensable guide to this flourishing yet little understood body of literature.', 273, 'BOOK', 53551, 'KRW', 'Oxford University Press', '2009-02-02', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=feMOPumxz-IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Since the 1960s, operating systems designers have explored how to build"secure" operating systems - operating systems whose mechanisms protect the system against a motivated adversary. Recently, the importance of ensuring such security has become a mainstream issue for all operating systems. In this book, we examine past research that outlines the requirements for a secure operating system and research that implements example systems that aim for such requirements. For system designs that aimed to satisfy these requirements,we see that the complexity of software systems often results in implementation challenges that we are still exploring to this day. However, if a system design does not aim for achieving the secure operating system requirements, then its security features fail to protect the system in a myriad of ways. We also study systems that have been retro-fit with secure operating system features after an initial deployment. In all cases, the conflict between function on one hand and security on the other leads to difficult choices and the potential for unwise compromises. From this book, we hope that systems designers and implementers will learn the requirements for operating systems that effectively enforce security and will better understand how to manage the balance between function and security."--BOOK JACKET.', 237, 'BOOK', 43475, 'KRW', 'Morgan & Claypool Publishers', '2008-01-01', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P4PYPSv8nBMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Summary Browser-based software can quickly become complex and difficult to maintain, especially when it’s implemented as a large single-page application. By adopting the micro frontends approach and designing your web apps as systems of features, you can deliver faster feature development, easier upgrades, and pick and choose the technology you use in your stack. Micro Frontends in Action is your guide to simplifying unwieldy frontends by composing them from small, well-defined units. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology Micro frontends deliver the same flexibility and maintainability to browser-based applications that microservices provide for backend systems. You design your project as a set of standalone components that include their own interfaces, logic, and storage. Then you develop these mini-applications independently and compose them in the browser. About the Book Micro Frontends in Action teaches you to apply the microservices approach to the frontend. You’ll start with the core micro frontend design ideas. Then, you’ll build an e-commerce application, working through practical issues like server-side and client-side composition, routing, and maintaining a consistent look and feel. Finally, you’ll explore team workflow patterns that maximize the benefit of developing application components independently.

The Lightning Guide to Databases with Microsoft Access and SQL is a fast and easy way to design your databases with Microsoft Access and using Structured Query Language (SQL). It is: · Very practical: based on learning-by-doing using clear database examples. · Very direct: goes straight to the point with a short and clear explanation of each topic. Each topic is later developed in deeper detail, for those interested in learning more about it. · Intended for all users: from MS-Access beginners to very experienced users. If you have some programing experience you will make the most out of this guide, and experience with spreadsheets is also useful – but neither are necessary. · Very broad: covers from the most basic questions about MS-Access, relational databases, and SQL (such as “what is a Table?”), to advanced features such as Forms, writing complex SQL Queries, Query testing, and debugging guidance. How do you use this Lightning Guide? This Lightning Guide is not designed to be read linearly like a book, and it is not intended to be read in full (although you can do both). Rather, it is written as a long list of Frequently Asked Questions, where each short section addresses a specific topic. You can just read the section or sections that are useful for you at any given moment. To easily find the solution to your specific doubt or question, this Lightning Guide is structured in short sections, each attempting to be reasonably self-contained and answering a specific question/problem that you may have. Sections include cross references to other sections, allowing you to follow up on the explanation of topics in other related sections in case you want to dig-in. There is also some redundancy between sections for the sake of self-containment, making it easier to find the desired answer as fast as possible. I therefore recommend using this Guide by searching for the specific question/problem that you have and going directly to the corresponding section. What version of Microsoft Access is this Guide for? Microsoft Access (MS-Access) is a computer program for building, maintaining and using relational databases. The explanation of the user interface and the exercises in this guide are for the 2021 English version of MS-Access 365, which is very similar to MS-Access 2019 and to MS-Access 2016. Besides, many of the concepts explained in this book are version-independent and apply to database design and database concepts themselves, being equally applicable to past and future versions. What is not in this Guide? This Lightning Guide explains in a clear, concise, and detailed way almost all MS-Access features and commands, which will allow you to exploit MS-Access in great dept. However, be aware this Guide covers Reports very lightly and does not cover macros. I would also like to clarify that this guide does not cover how to program in VBA. It explains how to use VBA code in MS-Access, and how VBA data types interact with SQL ones, but it does not provide a course on how to program in VBA. In case that you know some other imperative programming language like C or Java you will find VBA straightforward and will be able to code with it very fast using a few tips from web pages.', 760, 'BOOK', 12064, 'KRW', 'Arturo Azcorra-Saloña', '2021-08-27', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TYlCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Throughout, the contributors draw on feminist, queer, and intersectional criticism to engage with infrastructural and industrial issues. This focus reflects a concern about the systemic inequalities that emerge when tech companies and designers fail to address workplace discrimination and algorithmic violence and exclusions. Moving from smart phones to smart dust, the essayists examine topics like artificial intelligence, human-machine communication, and links between digital infrastructures and public service media alongside investigations into the algorithmic backends at Netflix and Spotify, Google’s hyperscale data centers, and video-on-demand services in India.

The world is changing rapidly with respect to developing threats, such as terrorism, and dual-use technologies, such as synthetic biology, that are challenging how we think about biosafety and biosecurity.

From the beginning, the concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS), or the sensing and control of physical phenomena through networks of devices that work together to achieve common goals, has been implicit in the IoT enterprise. This book focuses on the increasingly hot topic of Human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical Systems (HiTLCPS)—CPSs that incorporate human responses in IoT equation. Why have we not yet integrated the human component into CPSs? What are the major challenges to achieving HiTLCPS? How can we take advantage of ubiquitous sensing platforms, such as smartphones and personal devices to achieve that goal?

They come in all sizes, from inexpensive units for homes and small offices to equipment costing well over $100,000 and capable of routing at gigabit speeds. A fixture in today''s networks, Cisco claims roughly 70% of the router market, producing high-end switches, hubs, and other network hardware. One unifying thread runs through the product line: virtually all of Cisco''s products run the Internetwork Operating System, or IOS. If you work with Cisco routers, it''s likely that you deal with Cisco''s IOS software--an extremely powerful and complex operating system, with an equally complex configuration language. With a cryptic command-line interface and thousands of commands--some of which mean different things in different situations--it doesn''t have a reputation for being user-friendly. Fortunately, there''s help. This second edition of Cisco IOS in a Nutshell consolidates the most important commands and features of IOS into a single, well-organized volume that you''ll find refreshingly user-friendly. This handy, two-part reference covers IOS configuration for the TCP/IP protocol family. The first section includes chapters on the user interface, configuring lines and interfaces, access lists, routing protocols, and dial-on-demand routing and security. A brief, example-filled tutorial shows you how to accomplish common tasks. The second part is a classic O''Reilly quick reference to all the commands for working with TCP/IP and the lower-level protocols on which it relies. Brief descriptions and lists of options help you zero in on the commands you for the task at hand.

It goes on to describe simplified models to illustrate aeroelastic behaviour and aircraft response before introducing more advanced methodologies. Finally, it explains how industrial certification requirements for aeroelasticity and loads may be met and relates these to the earlier theoretical approaches used. Presents fundamentals of structural dynamics, aerodynamics, static and dynamic aeroelasticity, response and load calculations and testing techniques. Covers performance issues related to aeroelasticity such as flutter, control effectiveness, divergence and redistribution of lift. Includes up-to-date experimental methods and analysis.

Cyber security is concerned with the identification, avoidance, management and mitigation of risk in, or from, cyber space - the risk of harm and damage that might occur as the result of everything from individual carelessness, to organised criminality, to industrial and national security espionage and, at the extreme end of the scale, to disabling attacks against a country''s critical national infrastructure.

For maximum safety, it is no longer sufficient to merely control access rights. In order to fully protect multimedia data from piracy or unauthorized use, it must be secured through encryption prior to its transmission or distribution. Multimedia Content Encryption: Techniques and Applications presents the latest research results in this dynamic field. The book begins with the history of multimedia encryption and then examines general performance requirements of encryption and fundamental encrypting techniques. It discusses common techniques of complete, partial, and compression-combined encryption; as well as the more specialized forms, including perception, scalable, and commutative encryption. In addition, the author reviews watermarking and joint fingerprint embedding and decryption. Later chapters discuss typical attacks on multimedia encryption, as well as the principles for designing secure algorithms and various applications. An exploration of open issues, up-and-coming topics, and areas for further research rounds out the coverage.

It is becoming increasingly clear that traditional approaches are insufficiently able to account for employment relations processes and outcomes in a world wherein formal institutions are being rapidly transformed and partially dissolved, national boundaries become porous, and the sheer number of actors involved is increasing substantially. A shift in perspective is necessary, past the nationally bounded actor-institution dichotomy, towards an understanding of employment relations as fundamentally mediated by complex and emergent networks that connect a multitude of actors within and between countries. ? This volume provides a seminal starting point for such a paradigm shift by applying theories and methodologies from social network analysis to the study of employment relations. It develops a theoretical toolkit of mechanisms that operate within networks and shape employment relations processes and outcomes, such as wages, labour market policies and labour conflicts. It brings together insights from various projects that investigate the structure, functioning and impact of networks in employment relations through quantitative and qualitative methods. It will be of particular interest to students and scholars of employment relations across business and management, economics, political science, and sociology disciplines, as well as those interested in social networks. Managers, trade unions, employers’ organizations and state authorities at national and international levels will find it helpful in understanding how networks shape their world.', 267, 'BOOK', 90809, 'KRW', 'Taylor & Francis', '2022-07-15', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FDBxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

The authors highlighted the importance of performing an integrated design of the district, considering different sectors, different energy vectors and different operation modes. In order to better integrate renewable and residual energy sources (R²ES), careful design of systems and storage solutions should be performed. Different storage solutions were tested, ranging from large-scale thermal energy storage to vehicle batteries or the thermal mass of buildings. Van der Heijde et al. (2019) proposed a two-layer design optimization algorithm to design a district heating network with solar thermal collectors, seasonal thermal energy storage and excess heat injection. Pajot et al. (2019) also performed an optimization of the sizing and control of energy systems in a district equipped with heat pumps, with thermal energy storage or thermal mass utilization. A hybrid distribution system, coupling the thermal and electrical networks, was proposed by Widl et al. (2019). Arnaudo et al. (2019) used the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) concept to decrease the overloading of the electrical distribution network during heat pump operation. Finally, Kazmi et al.

The problem is that the available information is spread out all over the place, and if you were to put it on a spectrum from theory to practice, you would find a lot of material at the two ends but not much in the middle.

This book will guide you through the fundamentals of large-scale distributed systems, with just enough details and external references to dive deeper.

When building distributed applications, you need to be familiar with the network stack, data consistency models, scalability and reliability patterns, observability best practices, and much more.

Considering the uncertainty created by asynchrony and process crash failures in the context of message-passing systems, the book focuses on the main abstractions that one has to understand and master in order to be able to produce software with guaranteed properties. These fundamental abstractions are communication abstractions that allow the processes to communicate consistently (namely the register abstraction and the reliable broadcast abstraction), and the consensus agreement abstractions that allows them to cooperate despite failures. As they give a precise meaning to the words "communicate" and "agree" despite asynchrony and failures, these abstractions allow distributed programs to be designed with properties that can be stated and proved. Impossibility results are associated with these abstractions.

The lectures cover a wide range in the theoretical foundations of programming and give an up-to-date account of the semantic models and the related tools which have been developed in order to allow a rigorous discussion of the problems met in the construction of correct programs. In particular, methods for the specification and transformation of programs are considered in detail. One lecture is devoted to the formalization of concurrency and distributed systems and reflects their great importance in programming. Further topics are the verification of programs and the use of sophisticated type systems in programming. This compendium on the theoretical foundations of programming is also suitable as a textbook for special seminars on different aspects of this broad subject.', 532, 'BOOK', NULL, NULL, 'Springer Science & Business Media', '1991-10-04', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t64MyfksuWkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Thus the philosophy behind this book is to integrate the concepts, algorithm designs and implementations of distributed systems based on network programming. After using several materials of other textbooks and research books, we found that many texts treat the distributed systems with separation of concepts, algorithm design and network programming and it is very difficult for students to map the concepts of distributed systems to the algorithm design, prototyping and implementations.

Challenging the perception that the Berlin School is a sheer adherent of “slow cinema,” Landry closely analyzes the use of movement, dynamism, presence, and speed in a broad selection of films to show how filmmakers such as Christian Petzold, Angela Schanelec, Thomas Arslan, and Christoph Hochhäusler invoke the pulse of the kinesthetic and the tangibly affective. Her analysis draws on an array of film theories from early materialism to body theories, phenomenology, and contemporary affect theories. Arguing that these theories readily and energetically forge a path from film to performance, Landry traces a trajectory between the two through which live experience, presence, spectacle, intersubjectivity, and the body in motion emerge and powerfully intersect. Ultimately, Movement and Performance in Berlin School Cinema expands the methodological and disciplinary boundaries of film studies by offering new ways of articulating and understanding movement in cinema.', 235, 'BOOK', NULL, NULL, 'Indiana University Press', '2019-02-08', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a-JVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

It allows readers to analyze the scalability problem in detail and identify scalability anti-patterns and bottlenecks within an application. With the CloudScale method, software architects can analyze both existing and planned IT services. The method allows readers to answer questions like: • With an increasing number of users, can my service still deliver acceptable quality of service? • What if each user uses the service more intensively? Can my service still handle it with acceptable quality of service? • What if the number of users suddenly increases? Will my service still be able to handle it? • Will my service be cost-efficient? First the book addresses the importance of scalability, elasticity, and cost-efficiency as vital quality-related attributes of modern cloud computing applications. Following a brief overview of CloudScale, cloud computing applications are then introduced in detail and the aspects that need to be captured in models of such applications are discussed. In CloudScale, these aspects are captured in instances of the ScaleDL modeling language. Subsequently, the book describes the forward engineering part of CloudScale, which is applicable when developing a new service. It also outlines the reverse and reengineering parts of CloudScale, which come into play when an existing (legacy) service is modified.

Predictive analytics is the practice of using historical data, machine learning algorithms, and statistical models to forecast future outcomes and trends. By leveraging Big Data, predictive analytics allows organizations to anticipate future behaviors, market shifts, and operational needs with remarkable accuracy. This predictive power is transforming industries, from retail and healthcare to finance and manufacturing, by providing businesses with tools to make data-driven decisions rather than relying solely on intuition or past experience. The goal of this book is to explore the intersection of Big Data and Predictive Analytics, providing readers with both theoretical insights and practical approaches to harnessing predictive models in Big Data environments. Throughout the chapters, we will cover the various types of predictive models, including regression analysis, time-series forecasting, decision trees, and neural networks, highlighting how these models can be applied to Big Data to solve real-world challenges. These methodologies are essential for applications ranging from demand forecasting and fraud detection to personalized marketing and healthcare diagnostics. Data preparation plays a pivotal role in predictive analytics, and this book will delve into the critical process of cleaning, transforming, and normalizing Big Data to ensure accurate and reliable predictions. Additionally, we will explore the implementation of machine learning algorithms, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, which form the backbone of many predictive models used in modern business applications. One of the core themes of this book is to demonstrate how predictive analytics is not just a tool for data scientists but a crucial component of decision support systems, helping organizations make informed choices across various departments, including marketing, operations, and finance. The book will also address the challenges that come with predictive analytics, such as data quality, overfitting, and model interpretability, providing solutions to these common obstacles. Through detailed case studies, particularly in the financial, retail, and healthcare sectors, this book highlights the transformative impact of predictive analytics in Big Data. By the end of this book, readers will not only gain an understanding of the core principles of predictive analytics but will also be equipped with the knowledge to apply these techniques in their own organizations to drive meaningful business outcomes. We hope this book serves as both an academic resource and a practical guide, empowering professionals, researchers, and students to fully leverage predictive analytics in the context of Big Data.

Using discourse analysis, this book examines how the process of secession affects internal ethnic relations and analyses how politicians interpret events and present arguments with the intention to mobilize their constituencies for independence. With in-depth case studies on the Slovenian, the Croatian and the Montenegrin independence movements, and by looking at cases from Indonesia and Spain, the author investigates how rhetoric affect internal ethnic relations during secession and how events and debate shape each other. The author demonstrates how in some cases of self-determination elites push for a higher level of sovereignty in the name of economic advancement, whereas in other cases, self-determination movements refer to ethnic identity and human rights issues.

Self-healing has been well known in biological systems for many years: a typical example is the self-healing of human skin. Whilst a minor wound can be self-closed by blood clotting, a deep and wide cut needs external help by suturing. Inspired by this observation, this book proposes a two-step close-then-heal (CTH) scheme for healing wide-opened cracks in composite structures–by constrained shape recovery first, followed by molecular healing. It is demonstrated that the CTH scheme can heal wide-opened structural cracks repeatedly, efficiently, timely, and molecularly. It is believed that self-healing represents the next-generation technology and will become an engineering reality in the near future. The book consists of both fundamental background and practical skills for implementing the CTH scheme, with additional focus on understanding strain memory versus stress memory and healing efficiency evaluation under various fracture modes. Potential applications to civil engineering structures, including sealant for bridge decks and concrete pavements, and rutting resistant asphalt pavements, are also explored. This book will help readers to understand this emerging field, and to establish a framework for new innovation in this direction.

This book aims to explore in what ways the investigation of such processes can further our understanding of typological hierarchies. To this end, diachronic evidence about the origins of several phenomena described by typological hierarchies is discussed for several languages by a number of leading scholars in typology, historical linguistics, and language documentation. This evidence suggests a rethinking of possible explanations for typological hierarchies, as well as the very notion of typological universals in general.

Data-intensive systems support the use of large amounts of data strategically and efficiently to provide intelligence. For example, examining industrial sensor data or business process data can enhance production, guide proactive improvements of development processes, or optimize supply chain systems. Designing data-intensive software systems is difficult because distribution of knowledge across stakeholders creates a symmetry of ignorance, because a shared vision of the future requires the development of new knowledge that extends and synthesizes existing knowledge. Knowledge Management in the Development of Data-Intensive Systems addresses new challenges arising from knowledge management in the development of data-intensive software systems. These challenges concern requirements, architectural design, detailed design, implementation and maintenance. The book covers the current state and future directions of knowledge management in development of data-intensive software systems. The book features both academic and industrial contributions which discuss the role software engineering can play for addressing challenges that confront developing, maintaining and evolving systems;data-intensive software systems of cloud and mobile services; and the scalability requirements they imply.

Philosophical characterisations are given of technical artefacts, their context of use and of sociotechnical systems. Analyses are presented of how technical artefacts are designed in engineering and what types of technological knowledge is involved in engineering. And the issue is considered how engineers and others can or cannot influence the development of technology. These characterisations are complemented by ethical analyses of the moral status of technical artefacts and the possibilities and impossibilities for engineers to influence this status when designing artefacts and the sociotechnical systems in which artefacts are embedded. The running example in the book is aviation, where aeroplanes are examples of technical artefacts and the world aviation system is an example of a sociotechnical system. Issues related to the design of quiet aeroplane engines and the causes of aviation accidents are analysed for illustrating the moral status of designing, and the role of engineers therein.

This does not mean that tools typical for a civilization epoch determine it completely, but they change our way of perceiving and interpreting the world. There might have been many such epochs in the history of human civilization (much more than the three waves of agricultural, industrial and information civilization). This is expressed by the title Technen of the book, where n denotes a subsequent civilization epoch. During last fifty years we observed a decomposition of the old episteme (understood as a way of creating and interpreting knowledge characteristic for a given civilization epoch) of modernism, which was an episteme typical for industrial civilization. Today, the world is differently understood by the representatives of three different cultural spheres: of strict and natural sciences; of human and social sciences (especially by their part inclined towards postmodernism) and technical sciences that have a different episteme than even that of strict and natural sciences. Thus, we observe today not two cultures, but three different episteme. The book consists of four parts. First contains basic epistemological observations, second is devoted to selected elements of recent history of information technologies, third contains more detailed epistemological and general discussions, fourth specifies conclusions. The book is written from the cognitive perspective of technical sciences, with a full awareness – and discussion – of its differences from the cognitive perspective of strict sciences or human and social sciences.

Both have roots in a neglected problem: the resistance of Legacy economic sectors to innovation. While the U.S. has focused its policies on breakthrough innovations to create new economic frontiers like information technology and biotechnology, most of its economy is locked into Legacy sectors defended by technological/ economic/ political/ social paradigms that block competition from disruptive innovations that could challenge their models. Americans like to build technology "covered wagons" and take them "out west" to open new innovation frontiers; we don''t head our wagons "back east" to bring innovation to our Legacy sectors. By failing to do so, the economy misses a major opportunity for innovation, which is the bedrock of U.S. competitiveness and its standard of living. Technological Innovation in Legacy Sectors uses a new, unifying conceptual framework to identify the shared features underlying structural obstacles to innovation in major Legacy sectors: energy, air and auto transport, the electric power grid, buildings, manufacturing, agriculture, health care delivery and higher education, and develops approaches to understand and transform them. It finds both strengths and obstacles to innovation in the national innovation environments - a new concept that combines the innovation system and the broader innovation context - for a group of Asian and European economies. Manufacturing is a major Legacy sector that presents a particular challenge because it is a critical stage in the innovation process. By increasingly offshoring production, the U.S. is losing important parts of its innovation capacity. "Innovate here, produce here," where the U.S. took all the gains of its strong innovation system at every stage, is being replaced by "innovate here, produce there," which threatens to lead to "produce there, innovate there." To bring innovation to Legacy sectors, authors William Bonvillian and Charles Weiss recommend that policymakers focus on all stages of innovation from research through implementation. They should fill institutional gaps in the innovation system and take measures to address structural obstacles to needed disruptive innovations. In the specific case of advanced manufacturing, the production ecosystem can be recreated to reverse "jobless innovation" and add manufacturing-led innovation to the U.S.''s still-strong, research-oriented innovation system.', 381, 'BOOK', 100600, 'KRW', 'Oxford University Press', '2015-08-18', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3okvCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Now regarded as a classic, the "Boulder Thesis" created and popularized by Feld within the book generated enormous media attention nearly a decade ago. At that time, Boulder was an emerging startup laboratory—a hub of innovation building new tech businesses. It quickly accelerated into a world class ecosystem for entrepreneurs. Boulder''s entrepreneurial density, combined with the geographic concentration of entrepreneurial activity around the Boulder downtown core, made it a hotbed of startup activity. Feld was and is still there, as a keen observer and one of its leaders. As he notes simply in the new edition, humans are wired to start things. In a sense, that short Feld-ism accurately describes the startup revolution still taking hold throughout the world. Boulder is proof that innovation can happen anywhere, in any city. Thanks in part to the book, what happens in Boulder now leaves Boulder. Rapidly growing startup communities in Atlanta, Detroit, Denver, Kansas City, Nashville, and Indianapolis are just a few examples. Over the last decade, Feld has dispelled the myth that startups can only thrive in Silicon Valley. Startup communities continue to pop up across the U.S. and around the world, prompting fresh new revelations and stories from Feld about what''s happened over the last decade. Startup Communities 2e describes what makes a startup community ecosystem first click, then hum, and in time, excel.

Startup Cities explains the factors that determine local startup success based on a detailed comparison of regional startup cities—pairing the most successful and less successful cities within regions along with insights and implications from case studies of each of the model’s elements. The book compares local city pairs, highlighting factors that distinguish successful from less successful cities and presents implications for stakeholders that arise from these principles. Peter Cohan is a lecturer of Strategy at Babson College and one of the world’s leading authorities on regional startup ecosystems. Starting in 2012, he created and led Startup Strategy courses that explore four regional startup ecosystems—Hong Kong/Singapore, Israel, Paris, and Spain/Portugal. These courses are based on an original framework for evaluating why a few cities host most startup creation and the rest fail to do so. In running these courses, Peter has built a network of local policymakers, investors, entrepreneurs, and professors from which he draws practical insights for what distinguishes successful Startup Commons from their peers. The book provides vital benefits to these stakeholders.

There can be lots of trial and error, lots of missteps, and lots of valuable time and money squandered as companies scale. Matt Blumberg and his team understand the scaling challenges—they''ve been there, and it took them nearly 20 years to scale and achieve a successful exit. Along the way they learned what worked and what didn’t work, and they share their lessons learned in Startup CXO. Unlike other business books, Startup CXO is designed to help each functional leader understand how their function scales, what to anticipate as they scale, and what things to avoid. Beyond providing function-specific advice, tools, and tactics, Startup CXO is a resource for each team member to learn about the other functions, understand other functional challenges, and get greater clarity on how to collaborate effectively with the other functional leads. CEOs, Board members, and investors have a book they can consult to pinpoint areas of weakness and learn how to turn those into strengths. Startup CXO has in-depth chapters covering the nine most common functions in startups: finance, people, marketing, sales, customers, business development, product, operations, and privacy. Each functional section has a "CEO to CEO Advice" summary from Blumberg on what great looks like for that CXO, signs your CXO isn''t scaling, and how to engage with your CXO. Startup CXO also has a section on the future of executive work, fractional and interim roles. Written by leading practitioners in the newly emergent fractional executive world, each function is covered with useful tips on how to be a successful fractional executive as well as what to look for and how to manage fractional executives.

The last few decades have seen East Asian governments provide increasing support for startups—new, high-growth, technologically oriented firms. Yet, as the authors observe, such initiatives do not necessarily benefit the growth of startups as challengers to large, established firms. Rather, they often enable startups to function as boosters for the competitiveness of these firms. Startups, in short, are both disruptors to and resources for big businesses.

The growth and proliferation of innovation-driven startup activity is profound, unprecedented, and global in scope. Today, it is understood that communities of support and knowledge-sharing go along with other resources. The importance of collaboration and a long-term commitment has gained wider acceptance. These principles are adopted in many startup communities throughout the world. And yet, much more work is needed. Startup activity is highly concentrated in large cities. Governments and other actors such as large corporations and universities are not collaborating with each other nor with entrepreneurs as well as they could. Too often, these actors try to control activity or impose their view from the top-down, rather than supporting an environment that is led from the bottom-up. We continue to see a disconnect between an entrepreneurial mindset and that of many actors who wish to engage with and support entrepreneurship. There are structural reasons for this, but we can overcome many of these obstacles with appropriate focus and sustained practice. No one tells this story better than Brad Feld and Ian Hathaway. The Startup Community Way: Evolving an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem explores what makes startup communities thrive and how to improve collaboration in these rapidly evolving, complex environments. The Startup Community Way is an explanatory guide for startup communities. Rooted in the theory of complex systems, this book establishes the systemic properties of entrepreneurial ecosystems and explains why their complex nature leads people to make predictable mistakes. As complex systems, value creation occurs in startup communities primarily through the interaction of the "parts" - the people, organizations, resources, and conditions involved - not the parts themselves. This continual process of bottom-up interactions unfolds naturally, producing value in novel and unexpected ways. Through these complex, emergent processes, the whole becomes greater and substantially different than what the parts alone could produce. Because of this, participants must take a fundamentally different approach than is common in much of our civic and professional lives. Participants must take a whole-system view, rather than simply trying to optimize their individual part. They must prioritize experimentation and learning over planning and execution. Complex systems are uncertain and unpredictable. They cannot be controlled, only guided and influenced. Each startup community is unique. Replication is enticing but impossible. The race to become "The Next Silicon Valley" is futile - even Silicon Valley couldn''t recreate itself. This book: Offers practical advice for entrepreneurs, community builders, government officials, and other stakeholders who want to harness the power of entrepreneurship in their city Describes the core components of startup communities and entrepreneurial ecosystems, as well as an explanation of the differences between these two related, but distinct concepts Advances a new framework for effective startup community building based on the theory of complex systems and insights from systems thinking Includes contributions from leading entrepreneurial voices Is a must-have resource for entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, executives, business and community leaders, economic development authorities, policymakers, university officials, and anyone wishing to understand how startup communities work anywhere in the world', 368, 'BOOK', NULL, NULL, 'John Wiley & Sons', '2020-07-28', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3oDrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Or why do startups based in London receive higher valuations than those in Paris, Berlin, or Milan, even when they are based in similarly-sized economies, share the same industries, and often even have the same investors? Answering these questions, the authors present key topics, such as hierarchical and segmented approaches to startup valuation, business plans, and sensitivity analysis, many methods such as venture capital valuation, first Chicago valuation, scorecard valuation, Dave Berkus valuation, risk factor summation valuation, and discounted cash flow valuation, in addition to business valuation by data envelopment analysis and real options analysis, as well as critical conceptual issues in the valuation such as expected returns of the venture capital and price versus value concepts, among others.

The pace of technology change, the blurring of industry boundaries, and the agility and resources of startups in almost every industry segment demand it. Many companies have begun to adopt the principles of Lean Startup in order to increase the pace and agility of their innovation initiatives, but most have had limited success in doing so. Although the principles seem intuitive and straightforward, there are challenges to using them inside an existing company, especially in a manufacturing environment. The biggest requirements, beyond those espoused for startups, are: Developing a business model for the new venture that not only works in the marketplace but also works within the constraints of the corporation Managing the conflicts that inevitably arise with the current operating business; every business that has operated over decades has well-established ways of doing things that may not fit the required pace and flexibility required of a new venture Conducting business experiments with physical goods as well as with software offerings Managing the risk of investing in a new domain for executives that are used to investing where the risks are more clearly understood This book describes a systematic approach for implementing Lean Startup in large organizations. It builds on the principles of Lean Startup and adds additional practices required to manage the realities of the corporate context.

South Korea is well known for its transition from an impoverished nation to a model of rapid, sustainable growth. The economy emerged quickly away from the post-war damage, and the spread of illegal settlements was mitigated. The book describes a set of policies and planning actions implemented in the country''s fragile condition from the aftermath of the war in the 1950s to the present. The desirable state of balanced growth was supported by secured access to land for efficient uses and the governments'' timely intervention in the conflicts between landowners and de facto occupants. Careful management of land registration and land-related information is notable, and the promotion of land development for the benefit of the public has also been carried out. Despite ongoing debate on equitable land distribution, the unevenness of property ownership and imbalanced gain from real estate transactions were addressed based on public policies, with mixed results. Some cases like the Farmland Reform in the 1950s, the making of Gwangju Resettlement Town situated in today''s Seongnam, the processes of Land Readjustment Projects, and the redevelopment of the 104 Village - often referred to as the last moon village in Seoul - were included.

Scalable Big Data Architecture covers real-world, concrete industry use cases that leverage complex distributed applications , which involve web applications, RESTful API, and high throughput of large amount of data stored in highly scalable No-SQL data stores such as Couchbase and Elasticsearch. This book demonstrates how data processing can be done at scale from the usage of NoSQL datastores to the combination of Big Data distribution. When the data processing is too complex and involves different processing topology like long running jobs, stream processing, multiple data sources correlation, and machine learning, it’s often necessary to delegate the load to Hadoop or Spark and use the No-SQLto serve processed data in real time. This book shows you how to choose a relevant combination of big data technologies available within the Hadoop ecosystem. It focuses on processing long jobs, architecture, stream data patterns, log analysis, and real time analytics.

They are even shaping new forms of virtual reality. This growing digital transformation coupled with technological evolution and the development of computer computation is shaping a cyber society whose working mechanisms are grounded upon the production, deployment, and exploitation of big data. In the arts and humanities, however, the notion of big data is still in its embryonic stage, and only in the last few years, have arts and cultural organizations and institutions, artists, and humanists started to investigate, explore, and experiment with the deployment and exploitation of big data as well as understand the possible forms of collaborations based on it. Big Data in the Arts and Humanities: Theory and Practice explores the meaning, properties, and applications of big data. This book examines therelevance of big data to the arts and humanities, digital humanities, and management of big data with and for the arts and humanities. It explores the reasons and opportunities for the arts and humanities to embrace the big data revolution.

The issues discussed in Big Data''s Threat to Liberty: Surveillance, Nudging, and the Curation of Information are related to how we are constantly under surveillance. Data is gathered from our homes, our cars, our smartphones, various devices around the house, and public sources such as facial recognition enabled camera surveillance and various websites and social networks. Furthermore, the information gathered is used to influence our actions. Detailed personality profiles are utilized in order to make us purchase products and services, or pay our taxes, through tailor-made nudges aimed at irrational and subconscious mechanisms, and delivered with a level of precision only possible with Big Data-driven algorithmic curation of data. Finally, the information we receive through various media is curated by algorithms, and even people are curated in order to satisfy our desires. By providing us with what the algorithm believes we want, we are spared from the exposure of unpleasant information, and even unpleasant people. The ideological landscapes we traverse are thus characterized by conformity, and a concomitant tyranny of popular opinion becomes ever more coercive as this occurs.The question is: How does being constantly watched, manipulated, and having our world-views shaped as just described affect our freedom? In this book it is argued that Big Data''s threat to individual liberty is routinely misunderstood and underappreciated due to (a) vagueness resulting from the concept of liberty being used without it being defined, or (b) the use of definitions based on flawed understandings of what liberty is. In this new and unique contribution to the ethics of Big Data and artificial intelligence, both these challenges are thoroughly addressed. - Explanation of key Big Data–related technologies and how they affect modern society, including explanation of surveillance technologies and nudging algorithms, and how Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence algorithms are used to tailor and mold opinion - Conceptualization of the term liberty, making the concept tangible, as a clear understanding of various forms of liberty enables a proper debate about the effects of technology on liberty, and a debate about what sort of liberty we value - A thorough technical explanation of how Big Data influences individuals by way of surveillance that allows for detailed personality profiles, nudging, and the algorithmic curation of information', 156, 'BOOK', 174514, 'KRW', 'Academic Press', '2021-08-04', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QJ0tEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Visualizing Film History is an accessible introduction to archive-based digital scholarship in film and media studies and beyond. With a combined focus on the history of film historiography, archiving, and recent digital scholarship—covering a period from the "first wave" of film archiving in the early 1900s to recent data art—this book proposes ways to work critically with digitized archives and research methods. Christian Olesen encourages a shift towards new critical practices in the field with an in-depth assessment of and critical approach to doing film historiography with the latest digital tools and digitized archives. Olesen argues that if students, scholars and archivists are to fully realize the potential of emerging digital tools and methodologies, they must critically consider the roles that data analysis, visualization, interfaces and procedural human-machinery interactions play in producing knowledge in current film historical research.

From high-frequency trading firms demanding millisecond-level insights to retail banks seeking richer, personalized customer analytics, the scale, velocity, and variety of financial data have exploded. Traditional on-premises data warehouses and batch-oriented ETL pipelines struggle to keep pace with today’s requirements for real-time risk monitoring, fraud detection, algorithmic trading signals, and regulatory reporting. In parallel, the rise of cloud computing has unlocked virtually unlimited storage and compute capacity, democratized access to sophisticated analytics tools, and fostered an ecosystem of serverless and managed services designed for elasticity and resilience. This book, Cloud-Native Financial Data Engineering: Principles, Pipelines, and Scalable Architectures, is born out of the need to bridge these trends. It is written for data engineers, architects, and technology leaders who are tasked with designing and operating the next generation of financial data platforms. Whether you are building a streaming pipeline to ingest market quotes, an event-driven system to detect anomalous trading patterns, or a unified data lake that brings together transaction, customer, and risk data, the cloud offers a paradigm shift: you can focus on business logic and analytical value, rather than on undifferentiated heavy lifting of infrastructure. In the chapters that follow, we first establish the foundational principles of cloud-native data engineering in a financial context. We examine how to decompose monolithic ETL workflows into micro-services and pipelines, how to embrace immutable, append-only event stores, and how to design for failure and recovery at every layer. We then explore the core building blocks of modern data architecture: data ingestion patterns (batch, stream, change-data capture), transformation frameworks (serverless functions, containerized jobs, SQL-on-data-lake), metadata management, and orchestration engines. Along the way, we emphasize best practices for security, governance, and cost optimization—imperatives in a regulated, risk-averse industry. Subsequent sections dive into specialized topics that address the unique demands of financial workloads. We cover real-time analytics use cases such as market data enrichment, fraud-signal propagation, and credit-scoring model deployment. We unpack architectural patterns for high-throughput, low-latency pipelines—leveraging managed streaming platforms, serverless compute, column-arithmetic engines, and cloud-native message buses. We also address data quality and lineage at scale, showing how to embed continuous validation tests and visibility into every pipeline stage, thereby ensuring that trading strategies and risk models rest on a bedrock of trusted data. A recurring theme throughout this book is scalability: both horizontal scalability of compute and storage, and organizational scalability via self-service data platforms. We explore how to enable “data as a product” within your enterprise—providing domain teams with curated, discoverable datasets, APIs, and developer tooling so they can build analytics and machine-learning solutions without reinventing ingestion pipelines or wrestling with infrastructure details. This shift not only accelerates time to insight but also frees centralized engineering teams to focus on platform reliability, cost governance, and feature innovation. By combining conceptual frameworks with concrete, provider-agnostic examples, this book aims to be both a roadmap and a practical guide. Wherever possible, we illustrate patterns with code snippets and architectural diagrams, while also pointing to managed services offered by leading cloud providers. We encourage you to adapt these patterns to your organization’s existing standards and to rigorously validate them within your security and compliance constraints. As the lines between “finance” and “technology” continue to blur, the ability to engineer data pipelines that are resilient, elastic, and observably sound becomes a strategic differentiator. Whether you are modernizing a legacy data warehouse, building a next-gen risk platform, or architecting a real-time trading analytics engine, the cloud-native principles and patterns in this volume will equip you to deliver robust, cost-effective solutions that meet the exact demands of financial markets and regulatory bodies alike. We extend our gratitude to the practitioners, open-source contributors, and early adopters whose insights and feedback have shaped this book. It is our hope that by sharing these learnings, we collectively raise the bar for financial data engineering and help usher in an era where data-driven decisions can be made with confidence, speed, and scale.

This vast data becomes the new natural resource that these organizations must tap in to innovate and stay ahead of the competition, and they must do so in a secure environment that protects the data throughout its lifecyle and data access in real time at any time. When it comes to security, nothing can rival IBM® Z, the multi-workload transactional platform that powers the core business processes of the majority of the Fortune 500 enterprises with unmatched security, availability, reliability, and scalability. With core transactions and data originating on IBM Z, it simply makes sense for analytics to exist and run on the same platform. For years, some businesses chose to move their sensitive data off IBM Z to platforms that include data lakes, Hadoop, and warehouses for analytics processing. However, the massive growth of digital data, the punishing cost of security exposures as well as the unprecedented demand for instant actionable intelligence from data in real time have convinced them to rethink that decision and, instead, embrace the strategy of data gravity for analytics. At the core of data gravity is the conviction that analytics must exist and run where the data resides. An IBM client eloquently compares this change in analytics strategy to a shift from "moving the ocean to the boat to moving the boat to the ocean," where the boat is the analytics and the ocean is the data. IBM respects and invests heavily on data gravity because it recognizes the tremendous benefits that data gravity can deliver to you, including reduced cost and minimized security risks. IBM Machine Learning for z/OS® is one of the offerings that decidedly move analytics to Z where your mission-critical data resides. In the inherently secure Z environment, your machine learning scoring services can co-exist with your transactional applications and data, supporting high throughput and minimizing response time while delivering consistent service level agreements (SLAs). This book introduces Machine Learning for z/OS version 1.1.0 and describes its unique value proposition. It provides step-by-step guidance for you to get started with the program, including best practices for capacity planning, installation and configuration, administration and operation. Through a retail example, the book shows how you can use the versatile and intuitive web user interface to quickly train, build, evaluate, and deploy a model. Most importantly, it examines use cases across industries to illustrate how you can easily turn your massive data into valuable insights with Machine Learning for z/OS.', 202, 'BOOK', 0, 'KRW', 'IBM Redbooks', '2018-09-11', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cAxuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

Cloud computing courses have not found their way (yet) into mainstream college curricula. This book is written as a textbook on cloud computing for educational programs at colleges. It can also be used by cloud service providers who may be interested in offering a broader perspective of cloud computing to accompany their own customer and employee training programs. The typical reader is expected to have completed a couple of courses in programming using traditional high-level languages at the college-level, and is either a senior or a beginning graduate student in one of the science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields.

Which eschatological approach one uses will affect one’s understanding of the nature and practice of missions. Mission creep—the expansion of the church’s original objective(s)—is a real concern for the contemporary church, and how one understands eschatology affects one’s focus on missions. The mission of the church is narrow (Matt 28:18–20), and the calling of individual believers is broad (Rom 12:1–2). If we fail to make this crucial distinction, the church’s mission will lose its biblical emphasis. And if the church’s mission is lost, then the authority structure, instantiated in the offices and officers of the church, devolves into illegitimacy, because the church is no longer advancing the kingdom ends she was mandated to do by King Jesus. If the institutional church fails to do this, we will be relinquishing and abdicating and abandoning our most singular and particular and peculiar kingdom of God vocation: the harvesting, gathering, and perfecting of the saints.', 163, 'BOOK', 33889, 'KRW', 'Wipf and Stock Publishers', '2024-06-18', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nzsQEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

However, in their formal preparation for ministry, many clergy learn little or nothing about the achievements, methods, or implications of ecumenism. This failure to adequately educate and inspire successive generations of Christian leaders about the quest for the church''s visible unity risks not only an irretrievable loss of ecumenical memory, but also a return to a time in which ignorance, fear, mistrust, suspicion, stereotypes, caricatures, recrimination, anathematization--even persecution--characterized the relations between divided churches. Drawing on decades of reflection on ecumenical reception and formation, and using the Anglican Church of Canada as a model, this book presents an approach to teaching the practical and theological aspects of ecumenism in a way that is both holistic and pragmatic and offers the potential to raise up a new generation of church leaders who are also agents of reconciliation and Christian unity.', 182, 'BOOK', 33889, 'KRW', 'Wipf and Stock Publishers', '2022-01-13', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f6FcEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

We know much about the molecular-genetic and biochemical underpinnings of sensory and motor functions. Recent neuroimaging work has opened the door to investigating the neural underpinnings of higher-order cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and even free will. In these types of investigations, researchers apply specific stimuli to induce neural activity in the brain and look for the function in question. However, there may be more to the brain and its neuronal states than the changes in activity we induce by applying particular external stimuli. In Volume 2 of Unlocking the Brain, Georg Northoff addresses consciousness by hypothesizing about the relationship between particular neuronal mechanisms and the various phenomenal features of consciousness. Northoff puts consciousness in the context of the resting state of the brain thereby delivering a new point of view to the debate that permits very interesting insights into the nature of consciousness. Moreover, he describes and discusses detailed findings from different branches of neuroscience including single cell data, animal data, human imaging data, and psychiatric findings.

The book traces the unusual trajectory of this inspiring voice: Karsavin started his career as Russia’s brightest historian of Catholic mysticism; however, his radical methods – which were far ahead of their time – shocked his conservative colleagues. The shock continued when Karsavin turned to philosophy, writing flamboyant and dense essays in a polyphonic style, which both Marxists and religious traditionalists found provocative. There was no let-up after he was expelled by Lenin from Soviet Russia: in exile, he became a leading theorist in the Eurasian political movement, combining Orthodox theology with a left-wing political orientation. Finally, Karsavin found stability when he was invited to teach history in Lithuania: there he spent twenty years reworking his philosophy, before suffering the German and Soviet invasions of his new homeland, and then deportation and death.

After all, what could make us who we are if not the things we have experienced, thought, felt and desired on these idiosyncratic pathways through space and time that we call lives? And how can we retain these experiences, thoughts, feelings and desires if not through memory? On the other hand, most of what we have experienced has been forgotten. And there is now a considerable body of evidence that suggests that, even when we think we remember, our memories are likely to be distorted, sometimes beyond recognition. Imagine writing your autobiography, only to find that that most of it has been redacted, and much of the rest substantially rewritten. What would hold this book together? What would make it the unified and coherent account of a life? The answer, Mark Rowlands argues, lies, partially hidden, in a largely unrecognized form of memory-Rilkean memory. A Rilkean memory is produced when the content of a memory is lost but the act of remembering endures, in a new, mutated, form: a mood, a feeling, or a behavioral disposition. Rilkean memories play a significant role in holding the self together in the face of the poverty and inaccuracy of the contents of memory. But Rilkean memories are important not just because of what they are, but also because of what they were before they became such memories. Acts of remembering sculpt the contents of memories out of the slabs of remembered episodes. Our acts of remembering ensure that we are in the content of each of our memories-present in the way a sculptor is present in his creation-even when this content is lamentably sparse and endemically inaccurate.', 225, 'BOOK', 69855, 'KRW', 'Oxford University Press', '2016-10-14', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HC9ADQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

The concept of IoT is employed in almost all fields such as healthcare, smart cities, smart grids, energy distribution, agriculture, and even transportation. In a typical IoT-enabled network, smart sensors are geographically distributed to collect and process data within a smart infrastructure using an open channel, the Internet. However, the use of the Internet brings inherent vulnerabilities related to security (e.g., IoT devices can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques) and privacy (e.g., adversary performing inference and data poisoning attacks). Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) are the two most extensively used techniques in IoT-enabled networks to safeguard the integrity and availability of sensitive smart systems. However, the presence of a large volume of data i.e., dimensionality curse and cloud-based centralized deployment mechanism hurts the IDS performance in terms of intrusion detection tasks and increased latency for data processing. On the other hand, modelling CTI is challenging due to the limited labels of cyber threat sources, and analysing these sources to extract relevant threat information manually is a time-consuming and error-prone procedure that necessitates a large investment of resources. This thesis provides substantial contributions to research on the building of a distributed IDS, a hybrid feature selection approach, an automated CTI Modelling and Identification scheme, and a deep privacy-encoding module for enhancing security and privacy of IoT-enabled networks.', 225, 'BOOK', 56904, 'KRW', 'GRIN Verlag', '2022-04-11', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EMBpEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

However, there is a lot more to come from this technological Tsunami. In simple terms, Internet of Things is a network of interconnected objects or things with sensors, collecting data and making actionable decisions. With the arrival and adaptation of this technology, many questions regarding cyber security are raised. This master thesis examines the consumer perspective on key elements of the internet of things. The elements in focus are consumer awareness, the perception of privacy and perception of value. The relationship of these elements with Gender and Nationality is investigated. The study is based on the survey of respondents belonging to Austria and India. After interviewing two experts from the field of the internet of things and reviewing the literature, the vulnerabilities surrounding IoT were confirmed. Lack of consumer awareness is considered a hindrance in the adaptation of IoT, whereas the trust between technology and consumers has decreased over time. It is claimed that consumers do not value security enough to pay extra for it. However, the findings from this study suggest a shift in the understanding and attitude of the consumer base. The author finds while certain trends from previous researchers remain unchanged. There has been an increased awareness among consumers overall. Gender influences the awareness; value perception of consumers is also influenced by Gender and Nationality. The perception of privacy is negative and the trust of consumers remains low. Most people would like to see more work done by the industry and the government to increase consumer education regarding cybersecurity and Internet of Things.', 145, 'BOOK', 44855, 'KRW', 'GRIN Verlag', '2018-02-19', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7ctMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

To develop a lightweight cryptographic scheme for secured Authentication in IoT. To develop a multilevel security model by using Enhanced Cryptosystem for secured Authentication in IoT. To ensure reliable and secure communication and access across multiple co-operatively communicating devices in IoT ecosystems ensuring optimal security and authentication system is must. Though, IoT demands ensuring security and authentication for both “device level security” and “data security under communication”. Noticeably, the device level security addresses attack resilience from any unwanted or unexpected intruder by applying certain authentication variables or key agreement policies. However, in the last few years, the events pertaining to smart card loss attack (SCLA), Brute-Force attack, impersonation attack, data sniffing attack etc., have questioned major at-hand security solutions. The irony is, in the majority of IoT systems, the access information or the key agreement information is saved or preserved onto the local memory, which often broadens the horizon for data loss, or attack. In such classical approaches the possibility of SCLA, Impersonation and Brute-force attack can’t be neglected. And therefore, ensuring both system level access authentication is inevitable. In other words, strengthening data security in IoT systems is equally significant like device level security and authentication. Once system considers both data level security as well as device level authentication system retaining quality of content and hardware efficiency becomes equally inevitable. On the other hand, maintaining efficacy of the security system with higher authentication correctness amongst the gateways and communication devices is must. It demands a collaborative low-cost or lightweight security model to enable security while maintaining IoT- expectations like low-computation, lightweight computation, low-power consumption, better data quality, attack resilience and fast in response. It can be considered as the key driving force behind this research.', 130, 'BOOK', 54565, 'KRW', 'GRIN Verlag', '2024-04-19', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTMDEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api');

For Polanyi, in The Great Transformation, the utopian springs of the dogma of liberalism existed within the extension of the market mechanism to the ‘fictitious commodities’ of land, labour, and money. There was nothing natural about laissez-faire. The progress of the utopia of a self-regulating market was backed by the state and checked by a double movement, which attempted to subordinate the laws of the market to the substance of human society through principles of self-protection, legislative intervention, and regulation. For Hayek, in The Road to Serfdom, the utopia of freedom was threatened by the abandonment of individualism and classical liberalism. The tyranny of government interventionism led to the loss of freedom, the creation of an oppressive society, and the despotism of dictatorship that led to the serfdom of the individual. Economic planning in the form of socialism and fascism had commonalities that stifled individual freedom. Against the power of the state, the guiding principle of the policy of freedom for the individual was advocated. Taking these different aspects of market economy as its point of departure, this book promises to deliver a set of essays by leading commentators on twenty- first- century political economy debates relevant to the present conjuncture of neoliberalism.
